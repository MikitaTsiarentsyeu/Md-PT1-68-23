1. Prepare to read the contents of the file text.txt
2. Allow the user to enter a parameter "maximum number of characters per line", which must be greater than 35.
3. Format the text taking into account the maximum number of characters, but if a word does not fit entirely on a line, it should be moved to the next one, and the spacing between words should be evenly increased (similarly to the "Justify" function in text editors). There is a module called ‘textwrap’ which can do it, you may take a look at it but do not use for this task.
4. Write the resulting text to a new file and notify the user about it.
